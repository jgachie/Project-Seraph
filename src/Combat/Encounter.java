 * Encounters determine how many and what type of enemy the Player encounters. There are two types: 
 * Random encounters, which are triggered after the Player takes a certain number of steps, and will
 * usually contain normal run-of-the-mill monsters native to the environment; and set encounters, which
 * are triggered with the Player walks on certain tiles, and are usually reserved for bosses or special
 * fights.
